## FAQ

### Q: Why is this in a "workshop" folder?
**A:** This is a personal workspace for analysis and planning, separate from production code. It's a living laboratory for ideas, research, and documentation that supports development but isn't part of the deliverable plugin.

### Q: Should workshop docs be committed to git?
**A:** Yes! These docs are valuable project knowledge that should be version controlled and shared with the team. They evolve alongside the code.

### Q: Do I need to read everything before coding?
**A:** No. Use the "Quick Navigation" section above to jump to what's relevant for your role/task. Read more as needed.

### Q: What if I disagree with an analysis or decision?
**A:** Great! Open a discussion (GitHub issue, team meeting, etc.). Update the workshop docs if consensus changes. Document dissenting opinions in "Open Questions" section of future_tasks.md.

### Q: How often should these docs be updated?
**A:**
- `future_tasks.md`: Daily/weekly as tasks complete
- `mappings.md`: Per sprint if architecture changes
- `analysis.md`: Per major refactor or feature addition
- `readme.md`: Rarely (structure is mostly stable)

### Q: Can I add more files to the workshop?
**A:** Absolutely! Suggested additions:
- `research_notes.md` - Spikes and experiments
- `architecture_decisions.md` - ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- `performance_benchmarks.md` - Load testing results
- `user_feedback.md` - Feature requests and bug reports
- `meeting_notes/` - Design discussions
- `diagrams/` - Visual architecture diagrams

## Workshop Principles

### 1. Reasoning Before Conclusions
All analysis documents separate:
- **Reasoning:** Detailed exploration, questions, observations
- **Conclusions:** Summaries, recommendations, decisions

This ensures decisions are well-founded and can be re-evaluated.

### 2. Explicit Over Implicit
Don't assume knowledge. Spell out:
- Why decisions were made
- What alternatives were considered
- What trade-offs were accepted
- What assumptions are being made

### 3. Living Documentation
Docs are never "done." They evolve with:
- Code changes
- New insights
- Changing requirements
- Team learning

### 4. Accessible to All
Write for:
- Your future self (6 months from now)
- New team members (no context)
- Non-technical stakeholders (clear language)
- External contributors (open source friendly)

### 5. Action-Oriented
Every document should:
- Answer "What do I do next?"
- Link to relevant resources
- Provide concrete examples
- Include checklists and actionable steps

## Acknowledgments

This workshop documentation was created as part of the initial analysis and planning phase for transforming a simple Babylon.js prototype into a comprehensive WordPress 3D CMS plugin.

**Technologies Analyzed:**
- Babylon.js v6+ (3D engine)
- Havok Physics (WASM physics simulation)
- WordPress 5.9+ (CMS platform)
- Gutenberg Block Editor (content editor)

**Documentation Philosophy:**
Inspired by the concept of a "digital garden" - a place for ideas to grow, evolve, and be cultivated over time. This workshop is not static documentation but a living, breathing workspace that reflects the current understanding and future vision of the project.
